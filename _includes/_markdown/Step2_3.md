By default, your Discovery Freelancer install will be in C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Discovery Freelancer 4.91.0
1. Find your *Discovery* Freelancer installation
1.1 Place "%localappdata%\Discovery Freelancer 4.91.0" without the quotes into explorer if you installed to the default location
2. Make a shortcut to DSLauncher.exe to your desktop or wherever you place your game shortcuts
3. Run DSLauncher.exe through the shortcut you just made
3.1 If it complains about accounts ignore it for now
4. Patch the launcher when prompted (or select from the right)
5. Patch the game when prompted (or select from the right)
