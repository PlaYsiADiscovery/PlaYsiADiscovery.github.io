We aim to have as few rules as possible, but there does need to be some:
1. Don't use F1 or disconnect when interacting with other players.
2. Don't grief people
3. No Camera Ship without prior permission. (Nomad restart starts with a camera ship, you need to get out of it ASAP).
4. No inappropriate names, ie: slurs. I'm disappointed I even had to make this clear.
5. Have fun

Griefing sub-rules/clarifications.
1. You need to interact in system chat at 4km+ distance with someone before firing. ie: "It's time for you to die Playsia" or "1 million credits to live Playsia"
2. No ambushing people as they undock or jump into a system.
3. Player Bases and their Defence Platforms: Cannot be placed within firing range of jumpholes/jumpgates.
